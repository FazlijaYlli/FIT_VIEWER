## FIT File Viewer
### What is FIT File Viewer ?
Fit File Viewer, or FFV, is a dynamic website where you can upload a .fit file and then view its content on the website, using dynamically generated statistics and graphs.

### How is it made ?
Currently, the website will use PHP and JS (mostly npm packages) for its back-end.
On the front-end, I am simply using Bootstrap to provide a nice, dark and simple appearance to the website.
